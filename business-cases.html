            <h1>Job Allocation for Urban Maintenance</h1>

            <p class="highlight">Job Allocation for Urban Maintenance involves assigning tasks like road repairs, garbage collection, and utility maintenance based on priority. The heap allows efficient access to the highest-priority job, as the root node always holds the job with the highest priority. Using a heap data structure, jobs are inserted with priority values, and the highest-priority job is always at the root. The root is extracted to allocate the most important jobs first. This method ensures efficient job scheduling with O(log n) time complexity for both insertion and extraction, making it faster than sorting for large datasets.</p>

            <h2>Key Aspects</h2>
            <ul class="key-aspects">
                <li><b>Prioritizing Tasks</b>: Assigning higher priority to urgent or important jobs like repairing roads that may impact traffic.</li>
                <li><b>Resource Allocation</b>: Ensuring that workers, equipment, and materials are available and scheduled for tasks.</li>
                <li><b>Optimizing Workflows</b>: Minimizing delays and resource waste by organizing jobs in a logical sequence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Efficient Cable Network Management</h1>

            <p class="highlight">Efficient cable network management is a critical problem in urban areas where a vast amount of data, telecommunications, and power lines need to be organized and optimized. The goal is to minimize costs, maximize performance, and ensure redundancy for reliability.</p>
            <p class="highlight">To solve Efficient Cable Network Management using graphs, we treat the network as a graph where each building, switch, or node is a vertex, and each cable or connection between nodes is an edge. The objective is to design and manage the network efficiently by minimizing the total cost, ensuring connectivity, and optimizing for performance and redundancy.</p>

            <h2>Key Aspects</h2>
            <ul class="key-aspects">
                <li><strong>Finds the shortest path</strong> between nodes, ensuring the most efficient cable routing and data transmission paths.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimizing performance and redundancy,</strong> ensuring that the network is both fast and resilient to failure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(VÂ²)</p>
            <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(V + E)</p>
