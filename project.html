            Design a Smart Disaster Response and Evacuation System to efficiently manage rescue operations, prioritize high-risk areas, optimize evacuation routes, and allocate resources during emergencies like floods, earthquakes, or fires. The system should ensure real-time decision-making, minimize casualties, and optimize resource allocation.

        <div class="content">
        High-Risk Zone Prioritization is a method to sort and rank areas based on their risk severity levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to focus resources and actions on the most critical zones first. By assigning numerical values to severity levels, a max-heap is built, and heap sort is used to ensure the zones are prioritized, with high-risk zones at the top of the list.        </div>

        <div class="content">
        High-Risk Zone Prioritization using Heap Sort involves organizing zones based on their severity levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to ensure that the highest-priority zones appear first. Severity levels are assigned numerical values (e.g., High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1) for comparison. The process starts by building a max-heap, which ensures the highest severity is at the root. Then, elements are extracted from the heap one by one, each time reheapifying the remaining data to maintain the heap property. This sorting method produces a list of zones ordered by their severity, with high-risk zones prioritized at the top.        </div>

            Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which can represent road networks in the case of evacuation routes. In the context of disaster response, it can be used to determine the fastest or safest evacuation routes from various disaster zones to shelters, considering factors like distance, road conditions, and hazard levels.

            Dijkstra’s ensures that evacuees are directed along the fastest and safest routes to shelters, minimizing time and risk during evacuation. In a disaster scenario, routes can change due to road blockages, hazards, or infrastructure failures. Dijkstra’s can dynamically adjust by recalculating the shortest path based on real-time data. In the case of multiple evacuees or areas requiring attention, Dijkstra’s helps prioritize evacuation routes for the most vulnerable populations (e.g., those in high-risk zones).

            Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a weighted graph. In the context of disaster response, it helps design an efficient resource distribution network by minimizing the cost of distributing resources such as medical supplies, food, and rescue equipment to various disaster-hit zones. By ensuring the most cost-effective connections between distribution centers and affected areas, Kruskal's ensures that resources are allocated efficiently.

            By applying Hashing, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Kruskal's Algorithm, we can build a disaster response system that efficiently maps affected zones, optimizes evacuation routes, and minimizes resource distribution costs. Hashing ensures quick updates and retrieval of disaster impact data, Dijkstra’s guarantees the safest and fastest evacuation paths, and Kruskal’s minimizes the cost of connecting resource distribution points. Together, these algorithms enable a streamlined and effective disaster management system that enhances real-time decision-making and resource optimization.
