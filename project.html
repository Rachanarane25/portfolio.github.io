        <div class="content">
            <strong>Problem Description:</strong><br>
            Design a Smart Disaster Response and Evacuation System to efficiently manage rescue operations, prioritize high-risk areas, optimize evacuation routes, and allocate resources during emergencies like floods, earthquakes, or fires. The system should ensure real-time decision-making, minimize casualties, and optimize resource allocation.

        <!-- Disaster Impact Mapping -->
        <div class="sub-heading">1. Disaster Impact Mapping</div>
        <div class="content">
            Disaster Impact Mapping refers to the process of identifying and recording the areas affected by a disaster, such as floods, earthquakes, or fires. This mapping helps track the severity of the disaster in real-time and is essential for making informed decisions about rescue operations, resource allocation, and evacuation plans. The system ensures that all affected zones are recorded systematically, and updates are made dynamically as the disaster progresses.

        <div class="sub-heading">Key Aspects:</div>
        <ul class="key-aspects">
            <li>Continuously update affected zones and severity levels.</li>
            <li>Assign a numerical score to indicate disaster intensity.</li>
            <li>Ensure quick retrieval of data for decision-makers.</li>
            <li>Handle multiple zones or disasters without performance issues.</li>
            <li>Enable fast storage and retrieval of disaster data.</li>

        <div class="sub-heading">Algorithm Applied: Hashing</div>
        <div class="content">
            During disasters, the situation changes dynamically. Hashing allows quick updates to disaster zones and severity levels in constant time O(1) on average, ensuring real-time accuracy. Rescue teams and decision-makers need instant access to the severity of specific zones. Disasters often impact multiple zones. Hashing handles a large number of zones and data entries without performance drops, unlike linear or tree-based methods.

            Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, which can represent road networks in the case of evacuation routes. In the context of disaster response, it can be used to determine the fastest or safest evacuation routes from various disaster zones to shelters, considering factors like distance, road conditions, and hazard levels.

        <div class="sub-heading">Algorithm Applied: Dijkstra’s Algorithm</div>
        <div class="content">
            Dijkstra’s ensures that evacuees are directed along the fastest and safest routes to shelters, minimizing time and risk during evacuation. In a disaster scenario, routes can change due to road blockages, hazards, or infrastructure failures. Dijkstra’s can dynamically adjust by recalculating the shortest path based on real-time data. In the case of multiple evacuees or areas requiring attention, Dijkstra’s helps prioritize evacuation routes for the most vulnerable populations (e.g., those in high-risk zones).

        <div class="content">
            Kruskal's Algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a weighted graph. In the context of disaster response, it helps design an efficient resource distribution network by minimizing the cost of distributing resources such as medical supplies, food, and rescue equipment to various disaster-hit zones. By ensuring the most cost-effective connections between distribution centers and affected areas, Kruskal's ensures that resources are allocated efficiently.

            By applying Hashing, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and Kruskal's Algorithm, we can build a disaster response system that efficiently maps affected zones, optimizes evacuation routes, and minimizes resource distribution costs.
